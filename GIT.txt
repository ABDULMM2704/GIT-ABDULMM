GIT - This is a version control tool.It will maintain the diff versions of code developed.

EG: Dev1 is assigned with a task of preparing TEA

Steps:

1.Take water and boil it to 70c
2.Add Tea Powder and milk
3.Add 1 table spoon of sugar
4.stir it for 15min

Dev2 is assigned with a task of preparing TEA

Steps:

1.Take water and boil it to 70c
2.Add Tea Powder and milk
3.Add 1 table spoon of sugar
4.stir it for 5min

This code needs to be merged with master branch.When dev1 and dev2 are pushing commiting and pushing therir
code to master CODE CONFLICT occurs. only way to eradicate the conflict is to compromise. Two similar chages
cannot be pushed. 

GIT-HUB: Is a repository to store the developed code.

Basic Terminology:

add,commit,push,pull,clone,rebase,merge,braches

After installing we need to create a local repo.

Local Repo - it is a workplace which is isolated from other devs. after working on your code, you can 
commit your latest changes to master repo or dev branch.

Next goto your local folder and right click and select git bash here > git init

Step2: git remote add origin "your git url"

Step3: git pull origin master

add a file to your local repo

Step4: git add filename.txt

Step5: git commit -a -m "message"

Step6: git branch branchname

Step7: git checkout branchname

Rebase 

C1			C1
C2			C2
C3			C3
MASTER  C4		C4
			MASTER
Step8: git rebase branch
