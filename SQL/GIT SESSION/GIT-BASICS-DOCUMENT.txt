--Adding SSH to Git Hub

Your contributions may be from that machine, but you need to check how you have set up your remotes

try the following command:

	git remote -v

That will list your remotes

If it is something like

origin https://github.com/......

You are connecting over https, and not SSH

You'll need to remove that remote -

	git remote rm origin

Then, add that as the remote-

	git remote add origin "YOUR SSH PATH"
